# Goboard4Pluto.jl
Testing the JavaScript Go-Board by [@deebloo](https://github.com/deebloo/go-board) in a Pluto.jl notebook for Julia.

## Howto

- Install [Julia](https://julialang.org/)
- The following Julia shell should be in the root dir of this project, or just put the goboard.jl file there.
- In a Julia shell, hit ] to enter the package prompt, and enter "add Pluto", now [Pluto.jl](https://plutojl.org/) gets installed. (Hit backspace to leave the package prompt.)
- use Pluto; Pluto.run()
- Now a Pluto page will open in the default browser. You can open the notebook file from here.
